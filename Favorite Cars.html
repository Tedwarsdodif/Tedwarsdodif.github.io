<h2 id="bmw i8">BMW I8</h2>	
	<p>
The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 is part of BMW's electric fleet "Project i" being marketed as a new sub-brand, BMW i. The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency cycle, the range in EV mode is 24 km (15 mi) with a small amount of gasoline consumption. Its design is heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Homage concept car, which in turn pays homage to BMW's last production mid-engined sports car prior to the i8: the BMW M1.

The BMW i8 can accelerate from a dead-stop to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds[10][11] and has an electronic limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). The BMW i8 has a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km. The EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76 MPGe (3.1 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent) and 29 miles per gallon (6.7L) when running in pure gasoline mode (after the battery is drained empty).</p>

<h2 id="audi r8">Audi R8</h2>
	<p>The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car, which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. It was introduced by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006.

The car is exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's private subsidiary company manufacturing high performance automotive parts, Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH), and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo and presently the Lamborghini Huracán platform. The fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame, and uses an aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is built by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany.</p>

<h2 id="lamborghini aventador svj coupe">Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Coupe</h2>
	<p>The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engined sports car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini. In keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is named after a fighting bull. Aventador (pronounced [aβentaˈðoɾ]) earned the Trofeo de la Peña La Madroñera for its courage in the arena in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1993. Unveiled at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the Aventador SVJ (Super Veloce Jota) is a powerful and track focused iteration of the Aventador SV. The 6.5-litre L539 V12 engine used in the entire Aventador lineage has been reworked and now produces a maximum power output of 770 PS (566 kW; 759 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 720 N⋅m (531 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm. The weight saving measures such as the extensive use of carbon fibre and titanium in the exhaust system has brought the weight down to just 1,525 kg (3,362 lb), giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 1.98 kg/hp. The Aventador SVJ can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.6 seconds and can attain a top speed of over 349 km/h (217 mph).</p>

It was unveiled at the 2015 New York International Auto Show.[6][7] McLaren predicts that the model will help triple the company's sales volume by 2020,The car is powered by a new iteration of the 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine already used in the 650S and P1, designated M838T E with thirty percent of the parts redesigned. Arranged in the car as a rear-mid engine configuration, it delivers 562 hp (570 PS; 419 kW) and 443 lb⋅ft (601 N⋅m) of torque through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission developed by Graziano Trasmissioni.[9] The car can accelerate from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 3.2 seconds and can achieve a top speed of 204 mph (328 km/h). A total dry weight of 2,989 lb (1,356 kg) and maximum weight of 3,201 lb (1,452 kg) gives the 570S a power to weight ratio of 428 PS per tonne delivering a fuel economy of 25.5 miles per imperial gallon (11.1 L/100 km; 21.2 mpg‑US) and CO2 emissions of 249 g/km.</p>
